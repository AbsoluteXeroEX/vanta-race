Thank you for installing the Vanta Race mod! This mod is a continuation of the Nightars Race mod for vanilla Starbound. I hope you enjoy the new content as I continue to develop upon this! If you have any suggestions or need to report an issue, please use the GitHub page at https://github.com/AbsoluteXeroEX/vanta-race (I rarely check my Steam or the forums for anything, and get priority notifications with GitHub.)

To open this window at any time, you can use the S.A.I.L. interface as a Vanta character (disabled for vanilla races for now) or, if you have StardustLib or QuickBar Mini installed, use the Updates [!] button.

  "info" :
"^orange;Compatibility Notes:^reset;

Frackin' Universe [^red;Incompatible^reset;] - A number of the older Nightar assets are present here as well as within FU, so sideloading both of them together will cause the game to crash. For FU Nightar issues, please speak with Sayter or any of the other FU devs, as I've been mostly hands-off with their FU Nightar integration.

Ztarbound [^orange;Use Caution^reset;] - Included with this mod by default; will cause issues with other mods that include ZB core assets, may cause issues with other mods that simply 'use' ZB.
