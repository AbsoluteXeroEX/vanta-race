    "I neglected to elaborate on the significance of the dark markings that all Nightars are born with in my first book. These markings, which I have come to learn are called 'bratach', are more than what they appear to be. Somehow, the bratach are what ties all Nightars to living in darkness.",

    "Additionally, the bratach has an immense cultural significance, in that they are considered the \"true mark of a Nightar\". In a ritual that defies all science as we know it, a Nightar can be stripped of their bratach; since they no longer have these markings, they are cast out from society as a wretch, no longer belonging to the darkness.",

    "I learned that removing the bratach is more than just removing their identity as a Nightar. As explained previously, the bratach are a core part of Nightar physiology. Separating a Nightar from their bratach is more or less converting them from being able to live in darkness to being able to live in light.",

    "Under rare circumstances is a Nightar who is considered a criminal sentenced to exile; for them, exile is worse than a death sentence, for they no longer have their identity as a Nightar. To be stripped of your identity and treated as a wretch by those closest to you - family and friends alike - would truly be the worst hell to endure."
