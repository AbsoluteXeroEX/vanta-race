    "The Nightars' Imperial Era lasted for some thousands of years, up until they began slipping into their own technological era. It seems that the main reason they embraced technology to begin with was that it was a boon for their combat prowess. Once they reached the peak of their technological era, they began entering into a spacefaring era, which began raising concerns about how to rule colonies setup by Nightars.",

    "In an attempt to secure his rule, the last emperor forbade all off-world travel and ordered any and all ships capable of leaving the atmosphere to be dismantled. This particular fear of losing ruling power was seen as a weakness, and ended up leading to a massive civil war of succession that would end up lasting for centuries.",

    "Much of the Nightar society was fractured into many smaller settlements/tribes as a result; those remaining on their homeworld still fight for the imperial throne while the splinter groups have gone their separate ways for the most part, and no longer associate with their homeworld brethren, viewing their trifles as 'too child-like' for continued survival of the race as a whole."
