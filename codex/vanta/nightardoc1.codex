    "No one remembers who exxactly the first Nightars were; hardly any or them remember how they came to be, as time has whisked away their oldest memories. What IS known is that their first world is shrouded in darkness, as are the planets they mostly inhabit. Appearance-wise, they closely resemble humans in stature, they possess the tenacity of Florans, and are high-minded much like the Apex. Truly, they are a culmination of many things, both great and terrible.",

    "The Nightars thrive in shadow, shunning the light as a scourge that plagues them, though this seems to be more rooted in their core biology. It does, however, play an important significance in their culture, particularly where religion is concerned. Some of the more traditionalist settlements prohibit significant ceremonies, like marriage, from being held during any night where the moon's cycle is more than a quarter waxed or waned; they believe that doing so otherwise would spell disaster for the couple and their offspring.",

    "They look with disdain upon all creatures that dwell above ground, be they beasts or otherwise. This denotes a very xenophobic attitude towards other races, especially in the larger settlements. They believe those that are able to walk in the light of the sun and moon are vile, since the Nightars can only tread amongst the darkness without the help of their specialized armor and clothing.",

    "While they have mostly grievances for everything else, the Nightars are not ENTIRELY unwelcoming; anyone who can hold their own against the myriad cratures of shadow that live among their worlds is seen as a worthy individual. Also trade; they welcome merchants of all walks fairly openly otherwise."
