    "I was granted leave to stay among the Nightars and observe their way of life, so long as I didn't cause any upset in their establishment. I hope this record will provide some better insight into how they tick, for lack of a better term.",

    "I've often wondered how it is that the Nightar are so expansive as a species that they are virtually all over the galaxy, yet each community can remain completely autonomous. There was seemingly no 'main branch' of leadership, so to speak.",

    "Interestingly, each Nightar community is its own stratocracy; leaders of the military have the final say-so in dealings with any law among them. These laws can vary from establishment to establishment, and whenever travel is conducted, all Nightar adhere to the laws of the respective communities.",

    "It turns out that each community leader is appointed, and acts as an emmissary for their community to the others. In a strange sort of way, they are collectively a confederacy of sorts. This level of respect is instilled into each Nightar from an early age; 'respect thy neighbor', as it were."
