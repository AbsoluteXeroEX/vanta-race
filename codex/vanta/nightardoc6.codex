    "The Nightars' desire for knowledge and power has led them to be a very intelligent race, to the point of being on-par and, I daresay, perhaps elevated above the Apex. However, in all their knowing, not even they know how to draw energy from shadows. They assume that because it is an innate trait, that it is divine in nature. This strange ability allows them to conjure all manner of things from the very essence of darkness, and I believe, though cannot confirm it just yet, that this is why they have such an aversion to the light."
