    "Bladed weapons are very prominent throughout Nightarian society, even in these days. From simpler times of complete metal, their mastery over a certain exotic element allowed them to create enhanced weaponry. The Nightars believed (and many still do today) that swords are the most valuable weapons any warrior could have. This gave birth to a heavy cultural tie to swords, and many Nightars believed that once forged and taken up, a Nightar and their sword were forever bound to each other.",

    "Swords could be passed down from father to son; otherwise, they were burried with their owners. Stealing another's blade was considered a most cowardly act, and often resulted in execution if the thief was found. Some swords still in use today can be traced back through Nightar bloodlines as far back as to the beginning of their Imperial era. Of all of the blades that have been passed down and still in possession, they all have one thing in common: they are named.",

    "If a Nightarian warrior has carried a sword for several battles, there is little, if any, chance that it hasn't been given its own name. Even today, swords still hold cultural significance, especially among leadership. Whereas the Nightars enjoyed an imperial era for a time, it was eventually decided that military leaders would be in charge after a catastrophic civil war of succession broke out.",

    "Regardless, most swords employed by Nightars today are still mostly metal, with few exceptions being reforged into energy variants. Swords are still so prominent that you'd be considered extremely lucky (or UNlucky) to come across a Nightar wielding a firearm. Even with their advancements in technology, they still prefer the sword over the gun. Just be sure you don't end up on the wrong side of either when it comes to a Nightar."
