    "Though they thrive in shadow, Nightars also have an innate fear of darkness. This appears to come from having to contend with all manner of beasts that lurk below the surface of their planets alongside them. You'd initially think it was Orbides they had to deal with, considering most 'dark' worlds are home to the infamous 'hive' sections, but no. This apparently was something similar, but much more 'intelligent', as if it new which ones to stalk and take out and in which order.",

    "I try to imagine what sort of creature could possess that level of intelligence, and shudder each time. Imagine having to live in the dark and being afraid of it constantly, hearing whispers of a creature that knows its prey very well. I doubt any other race would be able to last as long as the Nightars have without the freedom of open areas and the light of the sun.",

    "They were able to kill quite a few, and when their research techniques progressed, they were able to learn much from this creature. It wasn't particularly strong, but it was highly intelligent and knew how to strike where it counted. It was also gifted with translucency to the point it was almost completely invisible, were it not for the subtle shifts in light when it moved. The Nightars dissected many of these to learn about its biology and eventually came up with an active cloaking tech for themselves.",

    "To think that Nightars would further master the dark by preying on their most dangerous hunter... They have truly become the masters of shadows."
