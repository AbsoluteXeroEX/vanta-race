    "\"Bear witness to the testimony of ^cyan;Regula Annias, The Banished One^reset;.\n\nIn my final days of being a faithful servant of the Dusk Father, I made a foolish decision to hear the pleas of one of the light-tainted. In hearing his words, I could not help but feel sympathy for this man we imprisoned, and went to plea for forgiveness on his behalf to His Emminence, Elder Valkris. My pleas fell on deaf ears, however, and not only was the prisoner immediately executed, but then I too was put to trial, accused of having been tainted by the light's influence. Thus, was I stripped of my Identity, and cast out to wander the lands beyond the safety of the city I was born to. Though I will have long departed this plane's physical existence, all I can do is write this memoir, and hope that someone may understand the seriousness of my crime. A Nightar must not fall to light's dastardly whispers, or else they will lose everything that makes them who they are. May my soul eventually find rest in the Dusk Halls."
