    "Interestingly, combat rites from the Nightar Imperial era are still practiced to this day amongst all known Nightar colonies, as they still believe in the old addage of 'live by the sword, die by the sword'. Their technology, coupled with their core biology, has allowed them to master the shadows to such an extensive degree that we may never fully comprehend.",

    "While it is customary for many Nightars to initiate combat when a leader announces an upcoming resignation, there seems to be a general rule of thumb that prohibits any Nightar from another 'tribe' to vie for the leadership position of another tribe. Those who violate this rule are considered to be like any invading enemy and are treated with utmost hostility, usually being executed on the spot. Needless to say, nobody from any other species may partake of this rite.",

    "Because of the now-scattered tribes in nearly all corners of the universe, the leadership structure has dramatically changed. Rather than having a focus on politics, the appointed leaders for these exodus groups seem to be more militaristic in their roles, carrying with them the title of ^cyan;Sparapet^reset;.",

    "This new structure has led to the Nightar society becoming a strange mix of a confederation and thalassocracy. Within their 'recognized' regions of space, whichever group's fleet/military might is the strongest is the one who makes the decisions for that given sector, although each 'division' is otherwise completely autonomous.",

    "Like most other species, they value their freedom, and so do not put themselves where they would be at a political disadvantage, possibly putting them under someone else's leadership. This has led to many skirmishes with other galactic governments, such as the Miniknog and even the Protectorate. They do not, however, shun business dealings with other species, for as closed-off as they keep themselves, they understand the benefits and importance of trading."
