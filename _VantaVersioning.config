Thank you for installing the Vanta Race mod! This mod is a continuation of the Nightars Race mod for vanilla Starbound. I hope you enjoy the new content as I continue to develop upon this! If you have any suggestions or need to report an issue, please use the GitHub page at https://github.com/AbsoluteXeroEX/vanta-race (I rarely check my Steam for anything, and get priority notifications with GitHub.)

Frackin' Universe - a few of the older Nightar assets are present here as well as within FU, so sideloading both of them together will cause the game to crash. For FU Nightar issues, please speak with Sayter or any of the other FU devs, as I've been mostly hands-off with their integration of them.)

Ztarbound - Included with this mod by default; will cause issues with other integrations.
