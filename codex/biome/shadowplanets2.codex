    "While exploring beneath the surface, we've come across the typical ores you would see in the deep undergrounds of typical planets. These are are more sparsely seeded, however, but we noticed we had collected some previously-unidentified ores as well. One of the two ores has a vibrant, blue hue to it. It's a bit darker than ferozium, but we can still work with it. We've taken to naming it Azurite, and on its own, aside from its color, it is as unremarkable as copper ore. While it can be put to use for armor and weaponry, it seems as though it is a missing 'half' of the other ore we discovered.",

    "The other ore we came across has a soft, red glow to it. According to some old, Avian lore in our library, the Stargazer caste once settled long ago upon a planet that had an ore with similar characteristics. It was this ore that was used to craft the first of their red crystals (supposedly), but was very sparse. They called it 'rubium', but we've taken to calling it 'crimsonium' to avoid confusion. I did say 'similar', as this ore has some extra properties that this supposed rubium lacked. Most notably, when paired with Azurite, they react to each other and immediately bond in an almost explosive manner.",

    "Because of this, we've had to set up two separate processing centers to make sure that we avoid losing more people. However, if done properly, they can be fused together to create a new alloy for armor and weaponry. Azurite seems to only be useful when bonded with its crimson counterpart, whereas crimsonium can be refined and used on its own to provide energy. We've done some field testing with experimental armors where azurite was the base, and added some small compartments for crimsonum rods to power it. Needless to say, we've created a terrifyingly efficient combination."
