### Instructions
Simply download the zip file and unzip to your Starbound /mods folder. For easier version control, it is recommended you download and install the GitHub Desktop application and clone the folder to your Starbound /mods folder instead.

If you would like to tinker with the Tiled map editor using the tilesets provided, merge the
/tiled folder here into the /tiled folder in your Starbound installation directory.
