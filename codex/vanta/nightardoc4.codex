    "Imagine living in fear of the light, a resource so invaluable to us that we take it for granted. The Nightar fear the unknown in ways we couldn't possibly comprehend. Their aversion to the light allows them to stay out of the affairs of other species, allowing them to take on more 'covert' style roles in their lives. In shadow, they excel in ways no other can stand on-par with. Unfortunately, it is because of this perk that they can easily infiltrate any major political government body, which, needless to say, hasn't really done them favors in terms of earning their trust as a whole. They tend to work as mercenaries, most of the time engaging in the more 'unsavory' fields of work, almost to the point of making enemies with penguins. If you ever cross paths with such a Nightarian individual, you would be wise to ensure their services are entrusted to you before your adversaries meet them."
