    "The Night King's men\nRun over and through\nOur men and women\nKnow what to do\nPick up your blades\nAnd steel thy souls\nSing to the night\nAs the bell tolls",

    "The Night King's men\nWill slay and rend\nTo fight as one\nTo break and bend\nSo take heed\nAnd stay inside\nLest the night\nBring crimson tide",

    "The Night King's men\nMarch by the hour\nWith blades in hand\nThe fields they scour\nThen all as one\nThey stand once more\nTo even the tide\nAnd settle the score",

    "The Night King's men\nBring peace as one\nThey see night's fall\nAnd fear it none\nSo stand close\nWith brother and friend\nTo march as one\nUntil Twilight's end"
